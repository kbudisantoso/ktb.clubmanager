# Contributor License Agreement

Thank you for your interest in contributing to ktb.clubmanager.

## Why This CLA?

This project uses a **dual licensing model**: the software is available under the open-source AGPL-3.0 license, and the Project Owner may additionally offer licenses under alternative terms ("dual licensing" here means AGPL-3.0 plus one or more alternative license options).

- **Open Source (AGPL-3.0):** The software is distributed under AGPL-3.0. You and everyone else can use, modify, and distribute it under those terms—including commercially.
- **Alternative Licensing:** To fund ongoing development and offer support/SaaS options, the Project Owner may also offer licenses under different terms to organizations that prefer not to comply with AGPL requirements.

**What you keep:**

- **Full rights to your code.** You can use your Contribution in any other project, commercially or otherwise.
- **AGPL-3.0 rights preserved.** Once distributed under AGPL-3.0, recipients retain those rights under the license terms.
- **Attribution via Git history.** Your authorship is preserved in commits.

**What you grant:** You allow the Project Owner to also offer your contributions under alternative license terms. This is what makes the dual licensing model possible.

**Inbound: AGPL-3.0.** Contributions are accepted for open-source distribution under AGPL-3.0. Additionally, you grant the Project Owner sublicensing rights for alternative licenses through this Agreement.

## 1. Definitions

**"Project Owner"** means Kresnadi T. Budisantoso as the owner of the ktb.clubmanager project, and any Successor Entity.

**"Successor Entity"** means any individual, company, or organization to which the Project Owner transfers or assigns ownership of the project as a whole, whether through sale, merger, reorganization, or other transfer of the entire project. Any Successor Entity is bound by this Agreement.

**"Authorized Licensing Partner"** means a third party explicitly authorized in writing by the Project Owner to grant licenses under terms other than the Project License on behalf of the Project Owner, subject to the terms specified in such written authorization.

**"You" / "Contributor"** means the individual or legal entity submitting a Contribution.

**"Contribution"** means any copyrightable work or patentable invention, including the original work and any modifications or additions to existing works, that you submit to this project.

**"Project"** means the ktb.clubmanager software as maintained and distributed by the Project Owner.

**"Project License"** means the AGPL-3.0 license under which the Project is distributed.

**"Alternative License Terms"** means any license terms other than the Project License (AGPL-3.0), including proprietary terms.

## 2. Grant of Copyright License

By submitting a Contribution, you grant the Project Owner a **non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free license** to your Contribution, including the right to:

1. **Reproduce** the Contribution in any form
2. **Distribute** the Contribution as part of the Project under the Project License (AGPL-3.0)
3. **Modify** and create derivative works
4. **Exploit** the Contribution as part of exercising the rights granted herein, without compensation
5. **Grant licenses to third parties** under Alternative License Terms (this is the core mechanism enabling dual licensing)
6. **Transfer** this license to a Successor Entity acquiring the Project as a whole

**Clarification on Alternative Licensing:** For clarity, this Agreement grants no right to sublicense under Alternative License Terms to anyone other than the Project Owner, any Successor Entity, or an Authorized Licensing Partner under § 4.2. This does not limit any rights under the Project License (AGPL-3.0).

**Contributor Rights Retained:** You retain all ownership rights to your Contribution and may use, license, or distribute it independently, including in other projects or for any purpose.

## 3. Patent License

You grant the Project Owner a **non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free patent license** to make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale, import, and otherwise transfer the Contribution, where such license applies only to patent claims licensable by you that are necessarily infringed by your Contribution alone or by combination of your Contribution with the Project.

**Defensive Termination:** If you or any entity you control initiates patent litigation (including cross-claims or counterclaims) against the Project Owner, any Successor Entity, or any user of the Project, alleging that the Contribution or the Project infringes a patent, the patent license granted by you under this section terminates as of the date such litigation is filed. This termination applies only to patent claims related to the Contribution or the Project.

## 4. Dual Licensing Rights

### 4.1 Alternative Licensing Authority

The Project Owner is the only party authorized by this Agreement to grant licenses for Contributions under Alternative License Terms. This authority includes:

1. Granting **licenses under Alternative License Terms** to third parties
2. **Operating the Project** (including Contributions) as a hosted or SaaS offering, whether under the Project License or Alternative License Terms—this describes the Project Owner's use of the granted rights and does not restrict others from hosting the software under AGPL-3.0
3. Offering **commercial support and services** related to the Project

This does not affect AGPL-3.0 rights: anyone may use, modify, distribute, and host the Project under AGPL-3.0, including for compensation.

### 4.2 Delegation to Authorized Licensing Partners

The Project Owner may authorize third parties to grant licenses under Alternative License Terms on behalf of the Project Owner ("Authorized Licensing Partners"). Such authorization must:

1. Be in **writing**
2. Specify the **scope** (territory, term, product versions, customer segments)
3. Be **non-transferable** (Partner may not further delegate without written consent)
4. Be **revocable** by the Project Owner with 30 days written notice, or immediately for cause
5. Specify the **effect of termination** on existing licenses granted by the Partner

**Default Rule on Termination:** Unless the written authorization specifies otherwise, upon termination of a Partner's authorization: (a) the Partner may not grant new licenses, and (b) licenses validly granted by the Partner prior to termination and within the scope of authorization remain in effect according to their terms, except where licenses were granted outside the authorized scope or obtained through fraud or misrepresentation.

### 4.3 Transfer to Successor Entity

The Project Owner may transfer all rights under this Agreement to a Successor Entity. Upon such transfer:

- The Successor Entity assumes all rights and obligations of the Project Owner under this Agreement
- The prior Project Owner's rights terminate
- The Project will continue to be available under the Project License (AGPL-3.0)
- Public notice of such transfer will be provided in the project repository

### 4.4 AGPL Rights Unaffected

Nothing in this Agreement restricts or limits the rights granted under the Project License (AGPL-3.0). Any party may use, modify, distribute, host, and commercially exploit the software under AGPL-3.0 terms. Sections 4.1–4.3 concern only the authority to grant licenses under Alternative License Terms.

## 5. Moral Rights

Your moral rights (Urheberpersönlichkeitsrecht under German law) remain with you and cannot be transferred. However, to enable the uses described in this Agreement and to the extent permitted by applicable law, you:

1. **Consent** to industry-standard modifications in the course of software development, including bug fixes, refactoring, security patches, performance improvements, and porting to other platforms
2. **Consent** to such modifications being made without prior consultation, provided they do not constitute a gross distortion or unreasonable impairment of your work (keine grobe Entstellung oder unzumutbare Beeinträchtigung im Sinne des § 14 UrhG)
3. **Accept** that attribution will be provided where customary and practicable through the project's Git history and standard open-source practices (e.g., AUTHORS file, commit history), rather than individual attribution in every distributed copy

## 6. Voluntary Contribution and Compensation

You submit your Contribution voluntarily and without expectation of compensation. You acknowledge that:

1. The license granted herein is **royalty-free** and you do not expect payment for the use, distribution, or licensing of your Contribution, including under Alternative License Terms (dual licensing)
2. You make this Contribution with full knowledge of the dual licensing model and **do not expect additional compensation** beyond the benefits of participation in an open-source project
3. Mandatory statutory compensation rights (such as § 32a UrhG) that cannot be waived by law remain unaffected

## 7. Contributor Representations

You represent that, to the best of your knowledge:

1. **Right to Submit:** You have the legal right to submit this Contribution and to grant the licenses in this Agreement.

2. **Original Work:** Your Contribution is your original creation, or you have clearly identified any third-party material, its source, and its license. You believe the licenses of any included third-party material are compatible with the Project License (AGPL-3.0). If you are unsure about license compatibility with dual licensing, please disclose this in your pull request.

3. **No Known Violations:** You have not knowingly included material that violates any third party's copyrights, patents, trademarks, trade secrets, or other rights.

4. **Employer:** If you are employed and your employer may have rights to intellectual property you create, you have permission to make this Contribution (whether through written authorization, employer policy, or employer waiver).

5. **AI-Assisted Code:** If any part of your Contribution was generated or assisted by AI tools, you take responsibility for it as if you had written it yourself and you have reviewed it for potential issues.

6. **Entity Authorization:** If you are signing on behalf of a legal entity, you have the authority to bind that entity.

## 8. Warranty and Liability

Your Contribution is provided "as is". You are not required to provide support for your Contribution.

**Warranty Disclaimer:** To the extent permitted by applicable law, you disclaim all warranties, express or implied, including warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.

**Liability:** You shall not be liable for any damages arising from the use of your Contribution, except where liability cannot be excluded by applicable law. In particular:

- Liability for **intentional misconduct** and **gross negligence** cannot be excluded
- Liability for **injury to life, body, or health** cannot be excluded
- Liability under **mandatory statutory provisions** (including the German Product Liability Act) remains unaffected

Nothing in this Agreement limits liability where exclusion is prohibited by applicable law.
